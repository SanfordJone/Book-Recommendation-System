# Book-Recommendation-System

The Book Recommendation System project is an application developed using Python, Flask, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary objective of this system is to provide personalized book recommendations to users based on the books they search for.

The user interface provides an autocomplete search box that suggests book titles as the user types. Once the user selects a book from the search box and submits the query, the system retrieves a list of recommended books. The recommendation is based on a dataset that includes the ratings given by users for books. The system analyzes the ratings given by users who have rated the selected book highly and recommends books that were also highly rated by those users.

The system utilizes a MySQL database to store information about books and user ratings. The application's back-end is implemented using Python and Flask, which provides the web framework for the application. The front-end interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Overall, the Book Recommendation System project is an application that can help users discover new books based on the ratings given by other users who have similar preferences.
